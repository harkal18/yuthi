Now you can send GET/POST request to an API simply using node cli using this module

#1 : INSTALL MODULE

npm i yuthi -g

#2 : SEND GET REQUEST

yuthi get http://yourdomain.com/address?param=value

#3 : SEND POST REQUEST

yuthi post http://yourdomain.com/address param1=val1,param2=val2

no need to use browser or any other app ;)

well,

there is lot more that can be done to this but for now this much is sufficient for me so i m leaving it here.

if you are intrested in developing furture get the code from github = > https://github.com/harkal18/yuthi
